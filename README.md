# semi-supervised-fisher-dictionary-learning
I study this paper named "LEARNING DISCRIMINATIVE DICTIONARIES WITH PARTIALLY LABELED DATA",write the code,I don't think my results are correct. There's something wrong with the code.
You just need to open main.m.
My example is a classification divided into two categories.
I have to emphasize that my code may be problematic and that optimization is not very good.
I hope someone can help me correct and optimize the code.
